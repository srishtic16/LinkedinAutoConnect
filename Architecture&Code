The goal was to create a Chrome extension that automates sending connection requests on LinkedIn and provides a real-time user interface (UI) to track the progress. The key challenges included:

1. Interacting with LinkedIn's DOM elements.
2. Keeping the user informed in real time through both a popup and an overlay UI.
3. Providing controls like Start and Stop to manage the operation dynamically.

The design was split into modular components based on Chrome's extension architecture:

Popup: Provides a user interface accessible from the browser's toolbar.
Content Script: Executes in the context of LinkedIn pages to interact with the DOM.
Background Script : Manages communication between the popup and the content script.
Manifest File: Defines the structure, permissions, and scope of the extension.
